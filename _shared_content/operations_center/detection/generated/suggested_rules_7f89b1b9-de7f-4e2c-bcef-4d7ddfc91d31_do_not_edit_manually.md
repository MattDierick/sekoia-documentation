??? abstract "Cryptomining"
    
    Detection of domain names potentially related to cryptomining activities.
    
    - **Effort:** master

??? abstract "Dynamic DNS Contacted"
    
    Detect communication with dynamic dns domain. This kind of domain is often used by attackers. This rule can trigger false positive in non-controlled environment because dynamic dns is not always malicious.
    
    - **Effort:** master

??? abstract "Exfiltration Domain"
    
    Detects traffic toward a domain flagged as a possible exfiltration vector.
    
    - **Effort:** master

??? abstract "Nimbo-C2 User Agent"
    
    Nimbo-C2 Uses an unusual User-Agent format in its implants.
    
    - **Effort:** intermediate

??? abstract "Potential Bazar Loader User-Agents"
    
    Detects potential Bazar loader communications through the user-agent
    
    - **Effort:** elementary

??? abstract "Potential Lemon Duck User-Agent"
    
    Detects LemonDuck user agent. The format used two sets of alphabetical characters separated by dashes, for example "User-Agent: Lemon-Duck-[A-Z]-[A-Z]".
    
    - **Effort:** elementary

??? abstract "Remote Access Tool Domain"
    
    Detects traffic toward a domain flagged as a Remote Administration Tool (RAT).
    
    - **Effort:** master

??? abstract "Remote Monitoring and Management Software - AnyDesk"
    
    Detect artifacts related to the installation or execution of the Remote Monitoring and Management tool AnyDesk.
    
    - **Effort:** master

??? abstract "SEKOIA.IO Intelligence Feed"
    
    Detect threats based on indicators of compromise (IOCs) collected by SEKOIA's Threat and Detection Research team.
    
    - **Effort:** elementary

??? abstract "Sekoia.io EICAR Detection"
    
    Detects observables in Sekoia.io CTI tagged as EICAR, which are fake samples meant to test detection.
    
    - **Effort:** master

??? abstract "Sign-In Via Known AiTM Phishing Kit"
    
    Detects a sign-in attempt from an IP address belonging to a known adversary-in-the-middle phishing kit.
    
    - **Effort:** elementary

??? abstract "TOR Usage Generic Rule"
    
    Detects TOR usage globally, whether the IP is a destination or source. TOR is short for The Onion Router, and it gets its name from how it works. TOR intercepts the network traffic from one or more apps on user’s computer, usually the user web browser, and shuffles it through a number of randomly-chosen computers before passing it on to its destination. This disguises user location, and makes it harder for servers to pick him/her out on repeat visits, or to tie together separate visits to different sites, this making tracking and surveillance more difficult. Before a network packet starts its journey, user’s computer chooses a random list of relays and repeatedly encrypts the data in multiple layers, like an onion. Each relay knows only enough to strip off the outermost layer of encryption, before passing what’s left on to the next relay in the list.
